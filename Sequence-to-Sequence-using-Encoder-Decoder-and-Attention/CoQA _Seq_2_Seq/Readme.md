CoQA is a large-scale dataset for building Conversational Question Answering systems. The goal of the CoQA challenge is to measure the ability of machines to understand a text passage and answer a series of interconnected questions that appear in a conversation. CoQA is pronounced as coca

CoQA contains 127,000+ questions with answers collected from 8000+ conversations. Each conversation is collected by pairing two crowdworkers to chat about a passage in the form of questions and answers. The unique features of CoQA include 1) the questions are conversational; 2) the answers can be free-form text; 3) each answer also comes with an evidence subsequence highlighted in the passage; and 4) the passages are collected from seven diverse domains. CoQA has a lot of challenging phenomena not present in existing reading comprehension datasets, e.g., coreference and pragmatic reasoning.
